# Cu29---Wavetable-Synthesizer
PIC Based Wavetable Synthesizer

- Source files for use in MPLABX IDE for PIC Microcontroller programming
- Target device: PIC16F1778
- Designed for external 49 key keyboard that outputs control voltage (CV) from
  1 to 5V and GATE signals (0 to 5V) to control note and on/off signals, respectively.
- Additional functions like PWM designed specifically to work with external circuits.
- ADSR envelope functions assume a voltage input of 0 to 4.8V
